"First concept: All of the data/variables/inputs are passed INTO the function. You can create as many variables in the function as you want, but only the values/data in the return statement are returned to the calling function\n",
"\n",
"Implications:\n",
"\n",
"When you are designing your function you should mentally (or on paper) write down\n",
"- Input: What data do you need?\n",
"- Output: What data are you going to return:\n",
"- Body of function: How is the output related to the input?\n",
"- Mathematical function\n",
" - Data manipulation (eg, reorganize the data into a dictionary, sort it, etc)\n",
" - Classification/Decision making (eg, does the data contain a zero? How many 1's in the data, etc)\n",
"- Practical: Scoping. The variables IN the function are not the same as the variables OUTSIDE the function - even if they have the same name. One way to think about it is that every variable in the function is actually called **func_name.a**, not **a** - and every variable outside the function is called **global.a**, not **a**.\n",
