"### Where is that item in the list?\n",
"One common task is to find things in numpy arrays - the first time a number in an array goes negative, all the places that are greater than some value, etc. You can always use a **for** loop, of course, to find things in a numpy array, but that can be... slow. Numpy has a general purpose set of functions for checking if there are negative numbers, counting the number, etc. You've already seen one such example - **count_nonzero**. \n",
"\n",
"In this tutorial we will practice using **np.where**, a general-purpose function that not only tells you if something is in an array, but also *where* it is. However, the syntax/format of the return value of this function is not exactly simple, so hence this tutorial."
