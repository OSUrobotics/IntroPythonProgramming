    "\n",
    "Strings are just arrays of characters. They are immutable - they can't be edited \"in place\". However, there are a lot of methods for cutting strings apart and gluing them back together again. So a typical string edit consists of taking part(s) of an existing string, transforming them (eg, converting to lower case, taking out white space), then gluing the results back together using + or f\"string\". \n",
    "\n",
    "A character is a single letter or symbol. They are represented internally as numbers - Google \"ASCII table\" - that we interpret as letters/numbers/symbols/whitespace, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are primarily used for displaying data in a \"human readable\" form, but they can also be used as parameters to functions and as keys in dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary \"gotcha\" of strings is that the string \"3.5\" is NOT the number 3.5 - it is three characters (\"3\" \".\" \"5\") that can be converted to an actual number (using casting, eg int(3)). Similarly, numbers can be converted to strings in order to print them out (eg f\"{x}\" will turn x into a string).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many utilities/functions for converting strings to specific data types (like numbers, dates, times) and back again. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many methods (strip() or replace() being the most common) for removing leading/trailing white space (strip) or replacing troublesome characters (like ' and -)\n",
