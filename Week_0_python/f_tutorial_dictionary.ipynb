    "# What are dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are values (pretty much any data structure/variable type you can think of) paired with keys (unique identifiers). Common key types are integers and strings. The best mental image for dictionaries are: I have a bunch of items that I can identify with a unique name (key/identifier). I want to be able to put them into the dictionary and get them back out again quickly and efficiently, using that unique name (key/identifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "What you can do with a dictionary:\n",
    " - Check if an item is in the dictionary\n",
    " - Put an item in/take it out\n",
    " - Loop over all of the items (or the keys) - CAVEAT: Not guaranteed to be in the order you put them in for older versions of Python...\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these operations are very fast - much faster than, say, searching through a list to see if an item is in the list"

    "For both of these examples we'll create the dictionaries from lists, since it's easier to make a self-contained example that way. However, you should think of those \"lists\" as being data read in from a file, data created by a function, etc\n",
