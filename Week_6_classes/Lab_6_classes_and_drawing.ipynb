    "\n",
    "It can be really hard to think about the whole `QuarterCar` at once. Classes are very useful ways of \"encapsulating\" data and functionality. We can use classes to encapsulate the knowledge needed to draw a quarter car.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to drawing a `QuarterCar`, there are many properties that are fixed, and a few that are influenced by the dynamic system comprised of the masses, springs, damper, and external forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The few properties influenced by the dynamic system are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `x` coordinate is dictated by the car's position on a 2-D \"road\" (a line).\n",
    "* The `y` coordinate the tire is dictated by the road location ($y_r$) at that `x` coordinate.\n",
    "* The `y` coordinate of the sprung mass ($y_s$) and the unsprung mass ($y_u$) are influenced by the forces acting on the whole `QuarterCar` system, which we will discuss in a future assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties then directly dictate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The length of the springs, since they bridge the tire and the unsprung mass, and the unsprung mass and the sprung mass.\n",
    "* The `y` coordinates of each component in the damper, as it is directly attached to the sprung and unsprung masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed properties, which do not vary, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The width and height of the sprung mass ($w_s$, $h_s$) and unsprung mass ($w_u$, $h_u$).\n",
    "* The width of the suspension spring ($w_{ss}$) and tire spring ($w_{ts}$)\n",
    "* The width and height of the damper cylinder ($w_c$, $h_c$)\n",
    "* The height of the sprung mass and unsprung mass rods ($h_{rs}$, $h_{ru}$)\n",
    "* The distance between the suspension spring and suspension damper ($d_s$)\n",
    "* The at-rest distance between the ground and the unsprung mass ($y_{u_{static}}$)\n",
    "* The at-rest distance between the ground and the sprung mass ($y_{s_{static}}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also fun properties that could be set, like the color to draw various bits of the car.\n",
