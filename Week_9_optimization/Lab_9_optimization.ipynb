    "We're going to set up an fmin problem where the goal is to find a launching velocity that launches a ball so that it passes through a \"hoop\". To make this problem \"interesting\" we're going to make it so we can change a bunch of things. These things are \"fixed\" for the run of fmin - i.e., we decide what they are and then solve for the launching velocity that gets the ball in the hoop. But we can set up, for example, that we have a really heavy ball that starts much lower than the hoop in very light gravity. More explicitly, these are the things we can change (see also images in slides)\n",
